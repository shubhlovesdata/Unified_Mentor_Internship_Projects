# Netflix Story Project

## Project Summary

The **Netflix Story** project is a data-driven exploration aimed at uncovering and showcasing trends within Netflix’s library. By utilizing a dataset sourced from Kaggle, this project transforms raw information into a visual narrative about streaming content.

The main objective is to use Tableau to dive deep into the data, identifying growth patterns, content distributions, and interesting facts about what Netflix offers its viewers.

## About the Data

The information for this study was pulled from Kaggle. It provides a detailed catalog of Netflix's titles, featuring data points like the type of production (movie or series), when it was released, where it was filmed, its length, and its genre. This data is the backbone of all our analysis and visual storytelling.

## Project Workflow

### 1. Data Preparation and Cleaning

Before building any charts, we spent time organizing and refining the data. This phase included:

- Resolving missing information and fixing inconsistencies.
- Reviewing the overall layout of the data.
- Detecting any unusual data points or outliers.

### 2. Tableau Data Visuals

The heart of this project is using Tableau to build an engaging visual experience. We developed interactive dashboards and maps to highlight important discoveries, such as:

- How Netflix’s library has expanded over time.
- The balance between movies and TV series.
- Geographic hotspots for content production.
- Analysis of popular genres and ratings.

### 3. Sharing the Story

Clear documentation is key to explaining our findings. This repository includes:

- A high-level overview of the project's purpose.
- Background on the Kaggle dataset.
- A breakdown of the Tableau dashboards and what they represent.
- Final thoughts and observations gathered from the data.
