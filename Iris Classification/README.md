![image_alt](https://github.com/shubhlovesdata/Unified_Mentor_Internship_Projects/blob/16f69f78eec020e79e4d3ca06879ade4d743ade5/Iris%20Classification/Iris-Dataset-Classification-1024x367.png)

This project focuses on building a machine learning model to classify iris flowers into three species — **Setosa**, **Versicolor**, and **Virginica** — based on their sepal and petal measurements.  
It is a classic supervised learning problem used to demonstrate classification techniques and model evaluation.

## Objective
- Understand the Iris dataset and its features
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Build and train classification models
- Evaluate model performance using standard metrics

## Dataset
- Source: dataset from Kaggle(https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/iris)
- Records: 150 samples
- Features:
  - Sepal Length
  - Sepal Width
  - Petal Length
  - Petal Width
- Target:
  - Iris-setosa
  - Iris-versicolor
  - Iris-virginica

## Exploratory Data Analysis
- Distribution analysis of sepal and petal features
- Relationship between features and flower species
- Identification of feature importance in classification

## Models Used
- Logistic Regression
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- Decision Tree (if applicable)

## Model Evaluation
- Accuracy Score
- Confusion Matrix
- Classification Report (Precision, Recall, F1-score)

The models achieve high accuracy due to the well-structured and separable nature of the Iris dataset.

## Tech Stack
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

## Outcome
This project demonstrates a complete machine learning workflow, from data exploration to model evaluation, and serves as a strong foundation for understanding classification algorithms.
