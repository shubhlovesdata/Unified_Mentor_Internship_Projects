This project focuses on building a machine learning model to classify iris flowers into three species — **Setosa**, **Versicolor**, and **Virginica** — based on their sepal and petal measurements.  
It is a classic supervised learning problem used to demonstrate classification techniques and model evaluation.

## Objective
- Understand the Iris dataset and its features
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Build and train classification models
- Evaluate model performance using standard metrics

## Dataset
- Source: dataset from Kaggle(https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/iris)
- Records: 150 samples
- Features:
  - Sepal Length
  - Sepal Width
  - Petal Length
  - Petal Width
- Target:
  - Iris-setosa
  - Iris-versicolor
  - Iris-virginica

## Exploratory Data Analysis
- Distribution analysis of sepal and petal features
- Relationship between features and flower species
